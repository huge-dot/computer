					CfA- Computer for All
				</h1>
				<p> The mission of Computers for All (CFA) is to enable the underserved communities of East Palo Alto and east Menlo Park to access the digital world through affordable education, equipment, connectivity, and support. Education and income are major factors in access to technology--the higher the income and educational attainment in the home, the more likely the home has at least one working computer and Internet connectivity.</p>

				<h2>Since 2009, CFE has opened doors to opportunities for our neighbors in the following ways:</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>433 individuals trained in digital literacy;</li>
					<li>over 1200 computers repaired at low-cost; </li>
					<li>almost 1000 computers refurbished and kept out of landfills; </li>
					<li>63 computer services interns trained here and acquired over 5,000 hours of job-site experience; </li>
					<li>    and over 6,000 community members used our WiFi 101 network to connect to the Internet.</li>

					<p>While these figures provide context, numbers alone cannot capture the spirit of CFE. We strive to be welcoming, affordable, supportive, and understanding. A typical day here at CFE reveals the ongoing technology needs of our surrounding communities. Calls come in or folks stop by throughout the day with questions ranging from password retrieval to software application problems. On any given day, you can find teens, seniors, single parents, extended families, or adult students at our shop having their equipment repaired or buying a refurbished systemâ€”all at costs they can afford. Intern technicians help support our goal while gaining valuable technical and customer service skills. Every day, our WiFi 101 network is running and allowing community members free Internet access from home.</p>

					<p>With a current operating budget of just under $100,000 and 3 staff members (one full-time and two part-time) this fiscal year, CFE runs a lean operation. However, larger needs remain. We have a waiting list of over a month for repairs. Despite the long queue, most community members do wait because CFE is the only place they can afford to take it.  In 2014, just minutes away from tech industry giants, the need for access to digital literacy trainings, low-cost repairs and equipment, and affordable Internet connectivity is as big as ever.</p>
